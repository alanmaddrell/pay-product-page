      <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK Pay is a payments service that’s built and maintained by the Government Digital Service, which is part of the Cabinet Office (“GDS”, “we”, “us”, “our”).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Public sector organisations use GOV.UK Pay to take payments online and over the phone. To do that, we collect, process and store certain data about you, acting as a data processor on behalf of these organisations. The organisations using GOV.UK Pay are the data controllers and they will have a privacy notice governing how they process and manage your data.</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">This privacy notice explains:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the kinds of data we collect and process in order to provide the payments service</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="why-we-need-your-data">Why we need your data</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">When you make a payment to a public sector organisation using GOV.UK Pay, we collect and process data about you in order to process that payment, and to monitor our service to protect against fraud and errors.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-data-we-need">What data we need</h2>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Contact details</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will collect personal data that includes your:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>names</li>
        <li>email addresses</li>
        <li>billing addresses</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Bank card details</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will collect bank card data that includes:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name on the relevant credit or debit card</li>
        <li>card type, like a debit or credit card</li>
        <li>card expiry date</li>
        <li>credit or debit card number - we will only keep the first six and last four digits for our records once the payment is made</li>
        <li>credit or debit card security code - this is not kept after the payment is processed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Payment transaction details </h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will collect payment transaction data that includes:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>payment amounts and frequencies including dates</li>
        <li>payment statuses </li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what-we-do-with-your-data">What we do with your data</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will use your data for different purposes.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Taking payments</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">We use your data to process the payment you have requested.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you enter into an agreement with a public sector organisation to allow them to take recurring payments, we will process your data in order to facilitate this process. Card details are securely stored for the duration of your agreement by the relevant payment provider that’s connected to the organisation you are paying. Stored card details are then used to process payments when requested by the public sector organisation.</p>
      
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Enabling public sector organisations to manage payments</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">The public sector organisation who requested your payment will have access to information about these payments through GOV.UK Pay. This is in order to allow them to perform any necessary administration and management such as financial reconciliation, reporting, or as part of delivering and operating their service.</p>
  

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Operation of GOV.UK Pay</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Members of the GOV.UK Pay team have access to information about payments and transactions processed on the platform in order to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>ensure that GOV.UK Pay operates as expected</li>
        <li>respond to any queries raised by the organisation or the payment provider in respect of the service</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We also collect aggregated anonymised statistics, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the number and aggregate value of payments processed by each public sector organisation who use GOV.UK Pay</li>
        <li>rates of successful and failed payments</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We use these for performance, reporting and continuous improvement. We may also share aggregate data with other public sector and government entities.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-long-we-keep-your-data">How long we keep your data</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will only retain your data for as long as:</p>

        <li>it’s needed for the purposes set out in this document</li>
        <li>is required by law</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 7 years.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how-we-protect-your-data-and-keep-it-secure">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, 
        both while it’s processed and when it’s stored. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access 
        or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of 
        encryption. From time to time we will test the system for security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Your personal data may, throughout the course of its processing at GDS, be transferred outside the UK. Where 
        this is the case all appropriate technical and legal safeguards will be put in place to make sure that you are 
        afforded the same level of protection as within the UK. We will only transfer your data to another country if 
        we are sure that there is enough protection in place to make sure that your data is secure.
