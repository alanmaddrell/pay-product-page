                    'https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/moto_payments/#take-a-payment-over-the-phone-moto-payments',

          %>. These are sometimes called ‘MOTO’ payments.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You get all the advantages and security of using GOV.UK Pay, but you fill in your users’ details on the payment pages for them.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can use this feature to take payments:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>over the phone</li>
          <li>from users details on paper forms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why use this feature</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          All of your payments will be in one system, there’s no need to use any other software. You simply use the same API as you do for online card payments. So all of your
          reporting, refund processing etc can all be done in the same place.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          This feature also gives customers an alternative way of paying. It allows services to easily help users that might be struggling to access an online service. This is

        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Other uses</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you already have a telephone payments system, but would like your online and phone payment records in one place, use your existing API endpoint to send us your
          telephone payments data.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This allows you to do all of your reporting and refunds in the same place.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Set up your account</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you want to take payments like this, just
          <%= mail_to 'govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk', 'get in touch', class: 'govuk-link' %>.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You’ll need to be
          <%= link_to 'PCI compliant', 'https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/security/#payment-card-industry-pci-compliance', class: 'govuk-link' %>
          and we’ll need to see evidence of this before we can set up your account to receive payments in this way.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Future developments</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’d like to add to this in future. We’re particularly interested in hearing about how you use, or might use, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) payments.
        </p>
